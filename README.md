# roguelike-c-
Hand made c++ roguelike game.

![lol](https://github.com/fl0wo/SquareGame-Cpp/blob/master/ezgif.com-gif-maker.gif)

todo : 

generalize enemy entities
add enemy random spawners

Add camera animation targes : (focus on all (avg) entities in certain distance from player.)

Add hearting life system. <3 <3 <3 (with also half herts)
Resize map making it bigger, optimize bfs alg for search perform only in visibility range and not complete map.

Split main.cpp in
Engine.cpp
UpdateView.cpp
Main.cpp

Create 2 types of Enemy : 
Bacterium (follows u until dont reach u and than explode breaking blocks around him in range)
Virus (follows u, while ur in his visibility range u take damage, speed < bacter speed)


Add potions
1 red +1hert restore helth
1 green slow move (timed)
1 blue reverse negative colors randomized rainbow.
1 yellow radar clockwise traversion illumination map.
1 pink extra golden hert + <3
1 purple confusion random swap keys : WASD -> DASW%rand();
...

buy OVH linux server
make server in c++/java as u want.

Many airports have moving conveyor belts in the corridors between halls and terminals. Instead of walking on the floor, passengers can choose to stand on a conveyor or, even better, walk on a conveyor to get to the end of the corridor much faster. The brand new Delft City Airport uses a similar system. However, in line with the latest fashion in airport architecture, there are no corridors: the entire airport is one big hall with a bunch of conveyor lines laid out on the floor arbitrarily. To get from a certain point A to a certain point B, a passenger can use any combination of walking on the floor and walking on conveyors. Passengers can hop on or off a conveyor at any point along the conveyor. It is also possible to cross a conveyor without actually standing on it.Walking on the floor goes at a speed of 1 meter/second.Walking forward on a conveyor goes at a total speed of 2 meter/second.Walking in reverse direction on a conveyor is useless and illegal, but you may walk on the floor immediately next to the conveyor. (Conveyors are infinitely thin.) How fast can you get from A to B?

### Built With

It's a pure C++ project. I've used a graphic library called SFML, really easy to use!

* See the documentation at [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Just clone the repository, install the following library, and run it in your IDE.
*Change C:/CLibraries/SFML with your SFML location path inside CMakeLists.txt
@DockerFile incoming soon anyway.

### Prerequisites

You only need to install one librabry to make it work:
* Installation guide: [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-vc.php)

### Geometric
Something magic is happening when 30Â° are hitten by the intersect line and the conveyor one.
* Explanation (todo)
